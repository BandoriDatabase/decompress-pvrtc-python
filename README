2bpp and 4bpp compressed versions of the Firefox logo live in img/. To create
more compressed images, you can modify img/makepvr.sh (should work on a Mac 
with developer tools installed).

To compile and run, just type "make", which does 2bpp decompression by default.
To see 4bpp decompression, run "make decompress-4". For now, you'll have to
change the hardcoded input and output strings in decompress.c if you want to
decompress different files.

The my_pvr.c library is still incomplete, but I'm attempting to rewrite the
Fortsiege PVRT library, which is translated from C++ and pretty hard to read.
